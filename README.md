So, I worked at a Business college a couple of years ago and they asked me if I could build a program that would scan through the Word document syllabuses built by professors and upload relevant information to our online platform using APIs. This is a prototype of that program, I wrote it in Java. The college ended up not moving forward with this, so I didn't get the chance to iterate on it, neaten it up, add comments etc. But here it us.
